# Loops and Cats

## Introduction:

If you're confused about the title of this repo, boots and cats is a beatboxer's equivalent of 'Hello World'.

## The Plan:

In two weeks, we're going to try and build a live looping application. The MVP specification is outlined below!

## MVP:

- Create a web app
- Record two Files
- Play them simultaneously
- Loop them
- Make it look presentable

### Developers
We're a small team of 4 aiming to build this product in 2 weeks. Fingers crossed!
